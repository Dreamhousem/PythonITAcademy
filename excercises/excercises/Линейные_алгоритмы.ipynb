Johnson.It uses fewer comparisons in the worst case than the best previously known algorithms, binary insertion sort and merge sort, and for 20 years it was the sorting algorithm with the fewest known comparisons. Although not of practical significance, it remains of theoretical interest in connection with the problem of sorting with a minimum number of comparisons. The same algorithm may have also been independently discovered by Stanislaw Trybula and Czen Ping."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to create a singly linked list, append some items and iterate through the list."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to find the size of a singly linked list."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to search a specific item in a singly linked list and return true if the item is found otherwise return false."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to access a specific item in a singly linked list using index value."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to set a new value of an item in a singly linked list using index value."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to delete the first item from a singly linked list."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to delete the last item from a singly linked list."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to create a doubly linked list, append some items and iterate through the list (print forward)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to create a doubly linked list and print nodes from current position to first node."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to count the number of items of a given doubly linked list."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to print a given doubly linked list in reverse order."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to insert an item in front of a given doubly linked list."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to search a specific item in a given doubly linked list and return true if the item is found otherwise return false."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Write a Python program to delete a specific item from a given doubly linked list."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Напишите ваше решение здесь"]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
